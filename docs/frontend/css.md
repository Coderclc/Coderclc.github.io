## Review

- selector + declaration block

- The range of element selectors is too wide, the range of ID selectors is too narrow, and class selectors are most suitable

- must end with a semicolon

- user-agent browser user default style sheet, different browsers are different

- What are the values ​​of color?

  - `<s>`<s>Expired Content</s>
  - <s>text-decoration:line-through overline</s>

- Talk about the rules of style priority

  - !important
  - Introducing method, inline is greater than embedding and external chain. Embedding and external chain look at the order of introduction, the latter covers the former
  - Priority of selectors id selector > (class selector | pseudo-class selector | attribute selector ) > (descendant selector | pseudo-element selector ) > (child selector | adjacent selector) > wildcard selector
  - inherited styles
  - Browser default style

- font-family can set multiple values, provided that the user's computer has this font

- text-indent text indent

- letter-spacing character spacing

- `<iframe>` for embedding in web pages

- `<object> <embed>` for embedding flash

- [MIME](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Glossary/MIME_type) Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension Type

- Pseudo-class selector love-hate law lvha `:hover` hover `:active` activate `:link` not visited `:visited` visited

  - `@font-face{}` directive to make a new font

- `<img />` tag white border problem solved

  - Set the parent element font size to 0, the side effect is that the element font disappears
  - Set picture as block box
  - Modify aligned baselines

- Guides - In-depth understanding of fonts Usually 5 guides

  - text top, ascent top line
  - super upper baseline
  - baseline baseline
  - sub lower baseline
  - text bottom, descent

- svg (scalable vector graphics) scalable vector graphics

  - The picture is written in code
  - Zooming will not be distorted, similar to python turtle drawing with code
  - Lightweight content
  - Instructions
    - Copy the source code directly -img backgroundimg
    - embed object iframe

- css data link

  - Write the data of the target file directly to the path location
  - dataMIME, data (MIME type is the way a file with a certain extension is set to be opened by an application)
  - advantage
    - Reduced browser requests and reduced request time
    - Facilitates dynamic generation of data
  - shortcoming
    - Increased the volume of resources, resulting in an increase in the transmission content
    - Not conducive to browser caching
  - Application scenarios
    - But the request for a single image is small, and the image is not suitable for making sprite images for various reasons
    - The picture is dynamically generated by other codes, and the picture is small, you can use data link

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="data:text/css,h1{color:blue;}" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="data:text/css;base64,aDF7Y29sb3I6Ymx1ZTt9" />
